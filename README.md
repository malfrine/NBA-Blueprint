# The Blueprint - Building a Winning NBA Roster

## Overview
The objective of this study is to build an NBA roster that wins the maximum number of games possible in a season while adhering to payroll constraints. In this repository, the scripts used to maximize the objective function can be found. Analytical and numerical methods were used.

## Scripts

"sym_ansol.m" - The optimization problem was developed using the symbolic package in MATLAB and solved using analytical solvers

"sym_numsol.m" - The optimization problem was developed using the symbolic package in MATLAB and solved using numerical solvers

"num_numsol.m" - The optimization problem was developed using the numerical optimization package in MATLAB 

"objfun.m" - Provides the objective function for "num_numsol.m"

"confuneq.m" - Provides the constraint equations for "num_numsol.m"
